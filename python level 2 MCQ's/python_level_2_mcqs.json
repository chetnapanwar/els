        {
            "question": "What will be the output of the following code snippet?\n\ndef outer(x):\n    def inner(y):\n        return x + y\n    return inner\n\na = outer(10)\nb = outer(20)\nprint(a(5), b(5))",

                "25 25",
                "Error"
            ],
            "answer": "15 25",
            "explanation": "This is an example of a closure. The inner function retains access to the variable 'x' from the outer function's scope even after the outer function has finished executing. 'a' has x=10 and 'b' has x=20."

            "question": "Which of the following is true about Python's 'global' keyword?",
            "options": [
                "It is used to create a new global variable inside a function.",
                "It allows a function to modify a variable defined in the global scope.",
                "It is mandatory to use 'global' to read a global variable.",
                "It makes a variable accessible only within the current module."
            ],
            "answer": "It allows a function to modify a variable defined in the global scope.",
            "explanation": "In Python, you can read a global variable without the 'global' keyword, but if you want to assign a new value to it (modify it) within a function, you must declare it as 'global'."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the primary difference between a list and a tuple in Python?",
            "options": [
                "Lists are faster than tuples.",
                "Lists are immutable, while tuples are mutable.",
                "Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.",
                "Tuples can only store integers."
            ],
            "answer": "Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.",
            "explanation": "Lists allow in-place modification (adding, removing, or changing elements), whereas tuples cannot be changed after creation."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the 'yield' keyword do in Python?",
            "options": [
                "It stops the execution of a function and returns a value.",
                "It turns a function into a generator, allowing it to return a stream of values one at a time.",
                "It is used to handle exceptions in a loop.",
                "It is an alias for the 'return' keyword."
            ],
            "answer": "It turns a function into a generator, allowing it to return a stream of values one at a time.",
            "explanation": "The 'yield' keyword is used in generator functions. It pauses the function's execution and saves its state, resuming from that point the next time the generator is called."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you handle multiple exceptions in a single 'except' block?",
            "options": [
                "except (ValueError, TypeError):",
                "except ValueError or TypeError:",

                "Multiple exceptions cannot be handled in one block."
            ],
            "answer": "except (ValueError, TypeError):",
            "explanation": "You can handle multiple exceptions by providing them as a tuple in the 'except' statement."

                16
            ],
            "explanation": "This is a list comprehension. It iterates through 0-4, filters for even numbers (0, 2, 4), and squares them, resulting in [0, 4, 16]."

            "question": "What is the purpose of the '__init__' method in a Python class?",
            "options": [
                "To destroy an object when it is no longer needed.",
                "To provide a string representation of the object.",

            ],
            "answer": "To initialize the attributes of an object when it is created.",
            "explanation": "The '__init__' method is the constructor in Python, called automatically when a new instance of the class is created."

            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a built-in Python data type?",

                "dictionary",

                "list"
            ],
            "answer": "array",
            "explanation": "While Python has a 'list' type and an 'array' module, 'array' itself is not a standard built-in type like list, set, or dict. Lists are commonly used for dynamic arrays."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the 'with' statement in Python ensure?",
            "options": [
                "That the code block executes as fast as possible.",
                "That resources like file streams are properly closed after use, even if an exception occurs.",
                "That a variable is only accessible within that block.",
                "That the code block will repeat until a condition is met."
            ],
            "answer": "That resources like file streams are properly closed after use, even if an exception occurs.",
            "explanation": "The 'with' statement is used for context management, ensuring that 'cleanup' actions (like closing a file or releasing a lock) are performed automatically."
        },

            "question": "In Python, what is 'self' in a class method?",

                "A keyword that refers to the class itself.",
                "A reference to the current instance of the class.",
                "A reserved word used to call the parent class methods.",
                "An optional parameter that can be named anything."
            ],
            "answer": "A reference to the current instance of the class.",
            "explanation": "By convention, 'self' is the first parameter of any instance method, allowing the code to access attributes and methods belonging to that specific object."
